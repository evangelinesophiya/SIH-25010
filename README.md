## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Smart Crop Advisory for Marginal Farmers (AgriSathi)

A low-cost, AI + IoT + voice-based platform that gives personalized crop advice to marginal farmers.

Key Features:

Smart Crop Choice – suggests profitable, climate-suitable crops.

Affordable Sensors – monitor soil & weather for timely irrigation/fertilizer advice.

Voice & SMS Alerts – simple tips in local language, no smartphone needed.

Micro-Advisory – low-cost fertilizer, water-saving, and pest control methods.

Market & Scheme Linkage – connects to buyers, FPOs, and government benefits.


Unique Advantage:
Practical, hyper-local, literacy-friendly, and resource-sensitive, designed especially for small landholders.

## Technical Approach

1. Data Collection

IoT sensors (soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity).

Satellite & weather APIs (rainfall, climate forecasts).

Farmer input (land size, crop history, resources).



2. Data Processing & Analysis

AI/ML models for crop suitability, yield prediction, pest/disease risk.

Decision support system to generate location-specific, resource-sensitive advice.



3. Advisory Delivery

Smartphone app (for digital farmers).

SMS/IVR (voice calls) in local languages for non-smartphone users.

Offline advisory kiosks in villages for broader access.



4. Integration Layer

Link to markets & government schemes for input supply, credit, and selling produce.

Farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing through community groups.



5. Feedback & Continuous Learning

Farmer feedback loop to improve AI recommendations over time.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility

Technical: Low-cost sensors + AI + SMS/IVR are already proven.

Operational: Easy rollout via FPOs/cooperatives, minimal training needed.

Economic: Affordable kits, support from govt/NGOs, reduces costs & boosts yield.


Viability

Scalable across regions with local data/languages.

Sustainable through higher income & lower input cost.

Adoption likely high since it’s simple, low-cost, and farmer-friendly.
## Impact and Benefits
Higher Yields → 15–20% increase with timely, precise advice.

Lower Costs → Saves 10–15% on water, fertilizer, and pesticides.

Risk Reduction → Early alerts for weather, pests, and diseases.

Better Market Access → Direct link to buyers, FPOs, and schemes.

Farmer Empowerment → Simple advice in local language improves decision-making.

Sustainability → Promotes resource-efficient and climate-resilient farming.
